# madrid-santiago-2019

This repo hosts a photobook.
Some of the stages of the development of the book are documented here.

The first stage was to create a template repository.
I did this using RStudio's GUI, and selecting the bookdown template when creating a new project (I'm not sure how to do that from the command line).

Next, the index file was generated as follows:

```{r}
index = photomapr::photobook_index(
  photobook_name = "From Madrid to Santiago de Compostela, 2019", photobook_author = "Robin and Katy", photobook_repo = "katyrobin/madrid-santiago-2019", photobook_description = "Photobook of our trip from Madrid to Santiago via Salamanca, Ourense and the Camino de Compostela.")
```
